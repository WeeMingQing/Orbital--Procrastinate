## Project Scope
> Our app aims to help students who are using our app to plan their schedule easily and revise efficently for their exams.

## Project Motivation
> As a student, I find that there are not many applications that provide students an easy way to set or create their schedule. 
> Hence, we would like to create an application that allows users to customise their schedule in a user-friendly manner. Furthermore,
> we decide to include other features such as flashcards to help students with their revision. Hence, we envision our application
> be a platform that host all sorts of services that a student will find useful during their learning.


## Proposed features
> Users are able to create and customize their schedule based on their needs.
> 
> Users are able to create flash cards and store them in the appropriate folder.
> 
> Users are able to view the flash cards that they have created.

## App design
> Our app has three main features. 
>>  1) Home Page
>>> Users will see all their important tasks set for the day
